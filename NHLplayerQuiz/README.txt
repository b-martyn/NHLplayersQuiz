NHL Players Quiz
~Developed by Brian Martyn

Connection to MySQL database that stores players in the NHL and creates a flashcard-like game that shows the number of a player on a team and present their first and last name and position on a click of the mouse on the screen.  This is a crowd sourced update list that creates a voting scheme on when the information needs to be updated.
